# Grade-Reporting-System

This was the final project for my high school computer science class and was finished in 2012.

The aim of the project is to provide an easier, user friendly and better report card generator and marks calculator for teachers. Through this program teachers can input, edit and delete records and along with that view individual report cards, overall toppers and records of all the students in a tabular and easy-to-view manner.
